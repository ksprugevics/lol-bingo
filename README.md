# A League of Legends bingo game

This was a small project to improve my HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery/Bootstrap skills.

## How to play
You are randomly generated a bingo card containing possible events that may occur in your LoL play session.

Whenever an event occurs in the game, you have to check the corresponding button on your bingo card. To win, you must get 4 events in one row/column/diagonal. To generate a new bingo card you can press the 'Restart!' button.
You can also switch between the regular and ARAM gamemodes by using the switch on the top-left corner.

Disclaimer: It is unlikely that you will get a bingo in one game, so be patient!
